# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar.[1][2] It has been running since 2015.[3]

The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language. Participants also compete based on speed on both global and private leaderboards.[1]

The event was founded and is maintained by software engineer Eric Wastl.
